        <p>My name is Dax Pandhi. I'm the founder of
            <a href="https://quadspinner.com">QuadSpinner</a>, where I have created software such as
            Gaea, GeoGlyph, and Helios.
        </p>
        <p>I'm also the founding trustee and director of the
            <a href="https://pandhi.org">Mahim Pandhi Wildlife Foundation</a>, where I head the
            <em>DesertCrocs </em>research project among others.
        </p>
        <p>I live on the "desert island" of Kutch, where I spend all of my free time
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/desertcrocs/">chasing crocodiles</a>.
        </p>
        <p>I occasionally speak at conventions, events, and schools (<em>SIGGRAPH</em>,
            <em>EUE</em>,
            <em>Mundos Digitales</em>, Harvard). I have previously taught environment design. You
            can find most of my public learning material on QuadSpinner's
            <a href="https://daxpandhi.com/about-3/youtube.com/quadspinner">YouTube</a> channel. My
            last book was
            <a href="https://github.com/QuadSpinner/RealismInVue/">
                <em>Realism in Vue</em>
            </a>, was very well received and is now
            <a href="https://github.com/QuadSpinner/RealismInVue/">available for free on GitHub</a>.
        </p>
        <p>A long time ago, I used to be an environment artist for films and games, including
            <em>Battlestar Galactica: Blood + Chrome</em>, <em>Call of Duty: Ghosts</em>, a cancelled
            <em>God of War</em> title, among others. These days, I'm more than happy to see talented
            artists use the tech we create at QuadSpinner to make environments for games like
            <em>Doom</em>,
            <em>Halo</em>,
            <em>Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order</em>,
            <em>Shadow of War</em>, among many others.
        </p>
        <p>I'm currently dividing my time between the leading the Gaea dev team spread across 3
            continents, and wildlife conservation efforts.</p>
        <p>You can follow me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daxpandhi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/daxpandhi/">Instagram</a>, or <a rel="me" href="https://hachyderm.io/@daxpandhi">Mastodon</a> to see what
            I'm up to these days.
