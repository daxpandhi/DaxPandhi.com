                                            a big influence for my art style. His depiction of nature has a
                                            beautiful balance of stark, bare elements that still reveal the gentle,
                                            harmonious shapes of the living world.</p>

                                        <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">
                                            Over the course of several years, I made several renders inspired by
                                            Shishkin. With each iteration, my understanding of light increased. In
                                            fact, I would say at least half of the quality of these renders comes
                                            solely from the light.
                                        </p>

                                            Every scene had a single light source. It was important for me to not
                                            fake any lighting and achieve the look soley through direct light and
                                            global illumination.
                                        </p>

                                            To ensure that reflected light was as realistic as possible, I created
                                            extensions of the landscape (including trees) behind the camera and
                                            beyond the frame. These trees helped with shadows coming from off-screen
                                            to depict a world beyond the frame, and reflected light from behind the
                                            camera with an accurate color.

                                            In 2021, stuck inside during the pandemic, I craved nature and wanted to try
                                            something bold and new. Shishkin has been a great influence on me, and so I
                                            decided to try and create something in his style. I poured over everything I

                                        <p>In April 2021, stuck inside during the pandemic, I craved nature and wanted
                                            to try something bold and new. Shishkin has been a great influence on me,
                                            and so I decided to try and create something in his style. I poured over
                                            everything I could find that he painted.</p>
                                        <p>It was not easy to replicate. Shishkin captured SO much detail in his
                                            paintings, it was hard to even figure out how to start.</p>
                                        <figure><img alt="" src="images/projects/shishkin/Shishkin.webp" />

                                        </figure>
                                        <p>I rarely have a visual end-result in mind when making my renders. Mostly it
                                            is just a feeling, style, light, or palette that I want to capture. The
                                            shape of it develops as I play with the scene and move it forward
                                            intuitively.</p>
                                        <p>To start, I made a displaced ground plane with heavy rocks. I manually shaped
                                            the terrain with soft-selected vertices and FFD transforms. To add some
                                            interest to the frame, I added a water surface. I added several trees, not
                                            for their visual but for their shadows to control the untamed brightness of
                                            the ground plane.</p>
                                        <figure><img alt="" src="images/projects/shishkin/Stage1-001.webp" />

                                        </figure>
                                        <p>This gave me a good starting point. As usual, whenever I get to a satisfying
                                            point in a scene, I will move the sunlight around. It does not mean
                                            necessarily finding a new light angle. In fact, most often I'll reset it
                                            back to what I had previously. By changing the light, the &quot;volume&quot;
                                            of the scene becomes visible and you get to see the elements differently.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>In this case, I changed the light so it came in from a high from the
                                            right-side outside the frame. Mid afternoon almost. This sparked the
                                            composition. Right heavy scene leading into the horizon on the left. The
                                            shadows had to be as important as the trees themselves.</p>
                                        <figure><img alt="" src="images/projects/shishkin/Stage1-008.webp" />

                                        </figure>
                                        <p>In these images you can see how the scene quickly evolved. It was mainly
                                            about building the layers of vegetation. (I will go more into detail about
                                            that later.) The sunlight was modified once the final elements were in place
                                            to make sure the right tree instances got light.</p>

                                            <p>It is very helpful to have multiple ForestPack populations for the same
                                                layer/species. Especially when you want a few specific trees to get
                                                special lighting. You can use different seeds and transformations, and
                                                when you need full manual control you can convert those few trees into
                                                editable instances. The rest of the forest still remains procedural and
                                                does not box you into manual management.</p>

                                        <p>I was very pleased with the result! It was going back to my roots of telling
                                            a story through the environment instead of having some monolithic object or
                                            character dominate the frame.</p>

                                        <p>Coming hot off the previous scene, I wanted to make another scene. As usual,
                                            the moment I published something is when I immediately start seeing all the
                                            flaws or missed opportunities.</p>
                                        <p>Apart from the hundreds of little things I could do have differently, my
                                            biggest gripe with the previous render was that it felt
                                            &quot;isolated&quot;. It didn't feel like there was a world beyond the

                                        <p>I decided to widen the frame and create a grander composition.</p>

                                            flatter. To start feeling my way to a decent level of grandness, I made a
                                            large grove of trees in the distance. They would be my
                                            &quot;measurement&quot;.</p>
                                        <figure><img alt="" src="images/projects/shishkin/Stage2-006.webp" />

                                        <p>The grove felt too dark, and in some ways too similar to the previous image.
                                            So moved the trees further back, behind the foreground terrain. They sat on
                                            a flat object hidden by the foreground. By sinking them lower than the
                                            horizon, it made them feel like part of a larger forest behind the immediate
                                            foreground.</p>

                                        <p>A small bunch of trees were left in the foreground. They were the perfect
                                            focal point. They conveyed the scale between the foreground and background
                                            while anchoring the composition.</p>

                                        <p>The foreground came together relatively quickly. Layering of multiple species
                                            at various levels of
                                            depth, and strategically placed trees at the edge of the frame added that
                                            &quot;world beyond&quot; that I failed to create in the
                                            first iteration.</p>

                                        <p>Here I want to talk about the failures that I didn't talk about in that
                                            article. To add more depth, I tried desperately to add a large distant
                                            terrain. Several attempts failed, but I kept trying to add it. In the end I
                                            ended up with a mix of hand-sculpted (FFD hell!) terrains covered with
                                            trees, and some scanned objects jammed in there to add complexity to the
                                            shape.</p>

                                        <p>This was a clear mistake. Look at this discarded attempt. I should have
                                            stopped here. Or even better, removed it completely.</p>

                                        <p>No, I went even further and added a terrain <strong>behind</strong> the large
                                            background terrain. Layers/depth add a sense of grandness, but these
                                            terrains were causing problems I was too close to see.</p>

                                        <p>The mountains were skewing the scale. They were stealing (or at least
                                            confusing) the focus from the middle ground.</p>
                                        <p>I removed the super large terrain in the background, but kept the other one.

                                        <p>It had been 10 days already! I wanted to be done with it! So I tweaked the
                                            background terrain and objects as best as I could and fired off the final
                                            render at <a href="https://ranchcomputing.com">Ranch Computing</a>.</p>
                                        <p>There were a few minor tweaks in post and it was published! People loved it,
                                            and I was pleased. Mostly. The composition kept niggling at me.</p>
                                        <p>But I moved on.</p>

                                        <p>Almost exactly 2 years later, in April 2023, I picked the scene up again. I
                                            felt like I had missed its greater potential.</p>
                                        <figure><img alt="" src="images/projects/shishkin/Stage5-007.webp" /></figure>
                                        <p>Simply adding a less-detailed but better scaled mountain in the back brought
                                            the image into balance! I was finally happy with the background.</p>
                                        <p>But I had learned a lot in these 2 years on other work. So I kept staring at
                                            this seemingly &quot;rectified&quot; background. What was wrong?</p>
                                        <p>It was flat.</p>
                                        <figure><img alt="" src="images/projects/shishkin/Stage5-009.webp" /></figure>
                                        <p>I tried modulating the terrain to create better canopy falloff and layering.
                                            It still felt off.</p>
                                        <p>Opening my Shishkin library, I started studying his work again with fresh
                                            eyes. And it suddenly was obvious - my lighting was flat! The shape of the
                                            hills didn't matter. Not the density/patch placement of the forest.
                                            Everything had turned into a single, noisy mass of green.</p>
                                        <figure><img alt="" src="images/projects/shishkin/Stage5-011.webp" /></figure>
                                        <p>To test this theory, I changed the lighting and several portions of the
                                            distant forest immediately looked better. My lighting WAS flat.</p>
                                        <figure><img alt="" src="images/projects/shishkin/Stage5-014.webp" /></figure>
                                        <p>First, I lowered the height of the distant terrain. I needed it to take up
                                            less space in the frame. Also, having it stretch further &quot;into&quot;
                                            the frame rather than vertically would let me control the visible depth of
                                            the scene. It meant having LOTS more tree instances, but that was worth the
                                            price.</p>
                                        <figure><img alt="" src="images/projects/shishkin/Stage5-018.webp" /></figure>
                                        <p>Second, I made a flattened sphere and placed it high up in the sky between
                                            the sun and the camera's view. It created a &quot;cloud shadow&quot; in the
                                            distant forest. Anything outside the frame that can affect the contents of
                                            the frame automatically tells our mind &quot;there is something beyond this
                                            frame&quot; and gives us that larger, connected world.</p>
                                        <figure><img alt="" src="images/projects/shishkin/Stage5-022.webp" /></figure>
                                        <p>The background terrain became more rolling. The endless forest was turned
                                            into patches of trees and LOTS of lush grass in between.</p>
                                        <p>I played with the background through several iterations - often trying to
                                            place a large terrain or rock formation with exposed rock to break up the
                                            monotony of the green forest. But this was going down the wrong direction.
                                            Eventually, I realized that each shape that did not directly contribute to
                                            the feel I was going for was just CG decoration.</p>
                                        <p>There was still no focal point or a story in the scene. It was still just a
                                            collection of pretty tree populations.</p>

                                        <p>I brought in some rocks from <img src="https://scanslibrary.com" alt="ScansLibrary">, favoring a few monolithic formations. After moving
                                            it around A LOT, I still could not get the &quot;story&quot;.</p>

                                        <p>At that point, I gave up on the rocks and deleted every rock formation across
                                            the scene. I took the camera several meters up in the air.</p>

                                        <p>While I have never painted <em>en plein air</em>, I've been photographing
                                            nature for decades. So I tried to tap into that mindset. As a photographer,
                                            you can't make modifications to the scene, you just have to frame your
                                            photograph in a way that makes the most out of the natural opportunities in
                                            front of you.</p>

                                        <p>The shadows in this new angle gave me the story. Light would again become the
                                            central &quot;character&quot;. I'd divide the frame into light and dark
                                            areas. The composition was altered to move the large trees in the frame
                                            center to the left. The large shadowy tree on the right would remain.</p>

                                        <p>The space between was opened up and that gave new opportunities for the
                                            distant forest. The distant terrain was flattened a lot more, and a new hill
                                            was created in the farther background. This terrain was discarded quickly as
                                            I felt a hint of horizon behind the forest would convey a more open, larger
                                            world than a large hill looming above the forest. It also created an
                                            imbalance of shadow.</p>
                                        <figure><img alt="" src="images/projects/shishkin/Stage5-064.webp" /></figure>
                                        <p>To add variety - both shape and color - I started bringing in new tree
                                            species in the far forest. Some had partially yellow leaves. They created
                                            beautiful silhouettes that conveyed depth and added more personality.</p>
                                        <figure><img alt="" src="images/projects/shishkin/Stage5-068.webp" /></figure>
                                        <p>I went back and forth with this forest along with the foreground (described
                                            next) to create a realistic forest by making 6 different ForestPack
                                            populations that created semi-manually placed groves of trees. The fully
                                            procedural way was not giving the exact results I needed. So I chose the
                                            type of distribution pattern I liked, and then painted the small groves -
                                            often overlapping with other species.</p>
                                        <figure><img alt="" src="images/projects/shishkin/Stage5-070.webp" /></figure>
                                        <p>A very large portion of this distant terrain was left open and populated with
                                            very dense grass. It still felt empty until a nice edge population of bushes
                                            and saplings were added.</p>
                                        <figure><img alt="" src="images/projects/shishkin/Stage5-085.webp" /></figure>
                                        <p>During this entire fight for the background, the foreground was undergoing
                                            dozens and dozens of iterations every night. I only had a couple of hours
                                            each night after work to spend on this scene. And that too not every day.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The reflecting pond became a very important factor to bring the whole scene
                                            together. The main trees went through a <strong>lot</strong> of minor
                                            tweaking repeatedly. In the end, they became real tree instances and not a
                                            ForestPack object. They were kept mostly like FP created them, but moved
                                            around precisely to create the most pleasing result.</p>
                                        <figure><img alt="" src="images/projects/shishkin/Stage5-089.webp" /></figure>
                                        <p>Some of the flatter ScansLibrary rocks were brought back to add some nice
                                            rocky extrusions in the pond.</p>
                                        <p>The scene needed life. It also needed a frame of reference for scale. The
                                            closest items to the camera are about a centimeter or two, while the
                                            farthest distance shows trees as tall as 20 meters! But it was not being
                                            conveyed properly.</p>
                                        <p>I brought in some dilapidated fences leading up to a rock cairn in the
                                            shadows. The fences were deliberately placed to look like they were dipping
                                            into the pond that had overflowed some of its limits. To me, such little
                                            touches add a feeling of &quot;rural&quot;.</p>
                                        <figure><img alt="" src="images/projects/shishkin/Stage5-046.webp" /></figure>
                                        <p>I brought in a short, stocky woman in a brown robe along with a taller woman
                                            in a white blouse. This was inspired directly by Disney's Robin Hood - i.e.,
                                            Maid Marian and Lady Kluck. A little path was made for them to walk on.</p>
                                        <p>On the far shore, a small group of European Spoonbills was added, while a
                                            flock of generic white birds flying out of trees was added to the left large
                                            trees, and another far in the forest.</p>
                                        <p>For the background, I wanted a vibrant sky. Without it, the shadowy lighting
                                            could look morose. I tried using a background image normally, but it looked
                                            off, and the VRay atmospheric perspective was not being applied to it like
                                            I'd wanted.</p>
                                        <figure><img alt="" src="images/projects/shishkin/Stage5-080.webp" /></figure>
                                        <p>So I made a large 16:9 flat plane in the distance. It was aligned and linked
                                            to the main camera. On it applied my bitmap with 100% self-illumination and
                                            disabled shadowing. The image itself is something I took right here at the
                                            <img src="https://quadspinner.com" alt="QuadSpinner office"> a few years
                                            ago.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Once everything was starting to come together, I added a lot of smaller
                                            details such as varied pebble sizes, sticks, fallen leaves, etc. In some of
                                            the barren areas, sparser, thinner grass was added to show new grass
                                            expansion as opposed to just reducing the size and density of the main grass
                                            at the edges.</p>
                                        <figure><img alt="" src="images/projects/shishkin/Stage5-114.webp" /></figure>
                                        <p>Throughout all these changes, I made several &quot;clouds&quot; or weirdly
                                            shaped sunlight blockers and strategically kept changing them to give me the
                                            right kind of shadows across the entire scene. These extremely simple
                                            objects more or less shape the feel of the scene!</p>
                                        <figure><img alt="" src="images/projects/shishkin/Stage5-120.webp" /></figure>
                                        <p>Marian was replaced by another hooded woman. And the rock cairn was replaced
                                            by graves. It made more sense to have nuns visiting graves at the edge of a
                                            village than two people out on a stroll.</p>
                                        <p>With some more tweaking of shadows and trees here and there in the distance,
                                            the scene was finally complete!</p>
